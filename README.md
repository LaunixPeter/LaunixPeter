Hi, I'm Peter!
I'm a software developer and part of the small German software startup Launix.
We use a self-invented logical programming language (FOP) to write commercial web software.

I'm interested to contribute in open source PHP projects that we use in our backend.

You can reach me at peter.eberhard@launix.de.
